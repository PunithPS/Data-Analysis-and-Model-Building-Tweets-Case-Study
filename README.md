# Data-Analysis-and-Model-Building-Tweets-Case-Study
The Project involves comprehensive data analysis and model building using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning Technique on a dataset of Tweets.

Primary Objective:
* Performing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to uncover pattrens and insights within the data.
* Preprocess the data to handel the missing values, remove noise and prepare data for modeling and applied CountVectorizer to 
  convert the text data into numerical values.
* Build and Evaluate ML Models such as Support Vector Machine, logistic regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest for task 
  like sentiment analysis. Use accurecy_score as evaluation metrics to evaluate the model performence
* Develop and fine tune DL models Including Recurrent Neural Netwrok(RNNs) and Tranformers to enhance prediction accuracy and 
 capture conplex pattrens in the text data

The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining traditional ML Methods with advanced DL Techniques to achieve robust and accurateresults in natural language processing tasks.
